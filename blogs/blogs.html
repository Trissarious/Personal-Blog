                        <p>
                            There’s a new teen drama on HBO that parents will want to know about. Euphoria follows "a group of high school students as they navigate drugs, sex, identity, trauma, 
                            social media, love and friendship." Euphoria (based on an Israeli mini-series of the same name) premiered on HBO June 16th, and releases new episodes on Sunday nights.

                        <p>
                            Even as someone who writes about movies for a living, I have to admit that I was in no rush to return to a brick-and-mortar theater. It had been 18 months since I’d last seen a 
                            film on the big screen. But sometimes exceptions need to be made, which is how I found myself sitting down (rather nervously and double-masked) in the too-packed confines of Alice Tully Hall for the New York Film Festival’s premiere of Dune.
