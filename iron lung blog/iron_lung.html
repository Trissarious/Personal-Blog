                                Mark Fischbach (a.k.a. Markiplier) has released a trailer for Iron Lung, a movie adaptation of the 2022 indie horror game of the same name. 
                                The YouTube icon is directing and stars in the movie, which is set to come to theaters sometime “soon.”
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Markiplier does indeed appear in the trailer, but you might not recognize him thanks to the very iron-y liquid he seems to be coated in. The footage has a thick cosmic
                                 horror vibe to it, with some of the visuals looking like they were pulled out of something like Stranger Things as the narrator lures viewers in. At only a minute-and-a-half 
                                 long, the Iron Lung movie trailer doesn’t really reveal how closely its story will follow David Szymanski original indie game. Regardless, it does seem like Markiplier is 
                                 doing his best to nail the tone, so be sure to check the Iron Lung trailer below.

                                Markiplier revealed his plans to create an Iron Lung movie earlier this year. At the time, the YouTuber-turned-filmmaker published a brief video that showed off how he and his
                                 team recreated the game’s submarine setting. The announcement also revealed that Markiplier will be joined on-screen by The Plot Against America actress Caroline Kaplan, while 
                                 he also serves as a producer alongside Will Hyde and Jeff Guerrero.

                                We know little about the story the Iron Lung movie will tell, but those looking to learn more can at least start with Markiplier’s “Lets Play” series for the game. Be sure to 
                                stay tuned for any updates while we wait for a solid release date.

                                Professional gamer and YouTube sensation Markiplier is directing and starring in Iron Lung, a movie adaptation of the indie horror video game of the same name. As reported by Deadline, 
                                production on the film is already underway in Austin, Texas. Details on how it will adapt the submarine thriller game are under wraps, but it will feature a script also written by the 
                                YouTuber, whose real name is Mark Fischbach. Markiplier is self-financing the project too. See a first look at the movie for yourself in the Iron Lung teaser below.

                                Iron Lung was released by developer David Szymanski in March of last year as an atmospheric horror story game that locks players inside a small submarine. It’s claustrophobic and brief 
                                but left an impact on those who played it. Markiplier was one of the individuals it impacted, and as you might have guessed, he posted his experience as a “Let’s Play” on his channel shortly 
                                after the game’s launch. A follow-up video was posted in July, in which the content creator touched on Iron Lung’s lore update. Needless to say, if you’re curious to see how Markiplier will bring 
                                Iron Lung to the big screen, these videos are a good place to start.

                                Markiplier will be joined on-screen by The Plot Against America actress Caroline Rose Kaplan. The YouTube star is producing the film alongside Will Hyde and Jeff Guerrero. As shown in today’s teaser, 
                                the nature of the original Iron Lung game means the film’s crew will likely be able to create the project on a low budget. Our first look at the live-action take on Szymanski’s rusty submarine is already 
                                enough to send chills down your spine, but let’s hope to see more soon.
